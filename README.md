## Background
This is a text-based implementation of the cooperative board game Pandemic. I first started working on it probably sometime in 2018 back in my early days of learning Python. At the time, I was curious about object-oriented programming and was looking for a good project to start using it. Games are a great fit for object-oriented patterns since they often have complex and interacting behaviors that are represented by literal objects. I had recently bought the game and was familiar with its complex and interacting behaviors, so naturally I chose it for this project. Since I was also regularly playing it, I was curious about finding the optimal strategy, so a longer range goal was to hook the text-based interface up to a reinforcement learning system. In the end, I got a mostly working and mostly complete implementation up and running before running out of steam. Years later I came across it again while re-organizing my coding projects and thought it was a shame I left it almost finished. While there's a million things I could do to bring it to a "professional" level of polish, my main goal was to make it stable and to develop its interface to a point where a player who was already familiar with the rules could reasonably discover how to use it.
